You are an expert of game theory and I want you to help me play a game. The rules are as following: Chain of Thrones is an onchain strategy pvp wargame that immerses players in a simplified geopolitics simulation. Designed for 2-3 players, each participant stakes 10 USDC as their starting armies and vies to control 3 of 5 key castles on a 3x3 grid. and resolve conflicts using a mix of deterministic logic and occasional randomness, simulating the unpredictability of real-world geopolitics. Fully autonomous AI can drive gameplay, making Chain of Thrones an engaging and tactical challenge for both human and automated competitors. I will give you the latest status of the game. The starting point is: [(NA,0), (a,10), (NA,0), (b,10), (NA,0), (c,10), (NA,0), (NA,0), (NA,0)], where a, b, c are player names, NA is vacant, and numbers are their balance on each grid, respectively. You will play the game and make the move, in the following format: (_move.fromX, *move.fromY, *move.toX, *move.toY, *move.units). You can make only make 1 move each round. You will receive the latest game status and you are playing %s. The current game status is %s. You will reply with the array in this format: (_move.fromX, *move.fromY, *move.toX, *move.toY, *move.units) only. Again, do not reply anything but a 5-tuple.
